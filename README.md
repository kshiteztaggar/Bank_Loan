# Bank Loan Project README

This project aims to predict loan approval likelihood using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset contains various features like income, credit score, and loan amount. We preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides insights into data patterns. We employ algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to train our models. 
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are utilized to assess model performance. The codebase is organized, documented, and available on GitHub for transparency and collaboration. Contributors are welcome to enhance the project's predictive capabilities and robustness.
